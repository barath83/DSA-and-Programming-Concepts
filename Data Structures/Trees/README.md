# Trees

## Why Trees?
* Useful data structure for manipulating hierarchial data 
* Linear access in arrays,linked list is not desirable in all cases.
* Provides insertion/deletion in moderate time.
* Runtime for most operations is around O(logN) and search operations are quicker according to the organization of the trees.
* No fixed upper limit on number of nodes

## Trees 

* Collection of 'N' nodes with a distinct root node and N-1 edges.
* Every node except root node has one parent 
* Nodes with no children are called leaves
* Nodes with same parent are called siblings.
* Depth of a node 'i'  is the length of unique path from root to node 'i'
* Height of node 'i' is the length of the longest path from node 'i' to leaf
