# Binary Tree

## Properties

* The maximum number of nodes at level 'l' is 2^l, since each node in binary tree has only two child nodes.
Level 0 has 2^0 = 1 node.

* The maximum number of nodes at height 'h' is (2^h)-1, height of the tree is the maximum number of nodes on the root to leaf path.

* The leaf node count is always one more than the node with two child nodes.
