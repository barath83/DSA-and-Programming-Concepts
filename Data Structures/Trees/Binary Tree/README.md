# Binary Tree

## Properties

* The maximum number of nodes at level 'l' is 2^l, since each node in binary tree has only two child nodes.
Level 0 has 2^0 = 1 node.

* The maximum number of nodes at height 'h' is (2^h)-1, height of the tree is the maximum number of nodes on the root to leaf path.

* The leaf node count is always one more than the node with two child nodes.

## Types of Binary Tree

* **Full Binary Tree** - It is a binary tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children. Also it can be defined as a tree where each node except leaf nodes have two child nodes.

* **Complete Binary Tree** - A complete binary tree is a binary tree if all the levels are completely filled except the last level and the lest level has keys left as possible.

* **Perfect Binary Tree** - A perfect binary tree is a tree in which all nodes have two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at same level.

* **Balanced Binary Tree** - A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
