# Doubly Linked List

> A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but it contains a extra pointer 'prev' which basically points to the previous node in the list.

## Advantages over singly linked list:
+ Can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
+ The delete operation in Doubly Linked List is more efficient if pointer to node to be deleted is given
+ Insertion can be done quickly before a given node.
